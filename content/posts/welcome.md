# Hello World!

This is my first post on my DevOps learning journey. This website is automatically deployed using GitHub Actions whenever I make changes.

## What I'm Learning

- Linux system administration
- Python programming for automation
- Cloud platforms (GCP, AWS)
- Infrastructure as Code with Terraform
- Containerization with Docker and Kubernetes
- CI/CD with GitHub Actions

## This Website

This website is built with:
- **Hugo** - Static site generator
- **GitHub Actions** - Automatic deployment
- **GitHub Pages** - Hosting

Every time I push changes to this repository, GitHub Actions automatically builds and deploys the site!

## Next Steps

I'll be documenting my progress through:
1. Linux fundamentals
2. Python scripting
3. Cloud migration projects
4. Infrastructure automation
5. Container orchestration

Stay tuned for more updates!
